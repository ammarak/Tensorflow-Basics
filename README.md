# Tensorflow-Basics
Understanding or Tensorflow and ANN from basics,  practical of gradient descents, optimizers, backpropagation, calculas


## What are we going to cover

* TensorFlow basics & fundamentals

* Preprocessing data (getting it into tensors)

* Building and using pretrained deep learning models

* Fitting a model to the data (learning patterns)

* Making predictions with a model (using patterns)

* Evaluating model predictions

* Saving and loading models

* Using a trained model to make predictions on custom data

What we're going to cover
TensorFlow is vast. But the main premise is simple: turn data into numbers (tensors) and build machine learning algorithms to find patterns in them.

In this notebook we cover some of the most fundamental TensorFlow operations, more specifically:

* Introduction to tensors (creating tensors)
* Getting information from tensors (tensor attributes)
* Manipulating tensors (tensor operations)
* Tensors and NumPy
* Using @tf.function (a way to speed up your regular Python functions)
* Using GPUs with TensorFlow
* Exercises to try
